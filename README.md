# WeSearch_API_Challenge

This repository was created as per the requirements of the WeSearch API coding test. It includes a Python script which gains access to the API using user credentials, and then allows said user to create and populate a collection. 

## Additional Information

The code included in the Python script contains several commented chunks. These chunks serve as checkpoints allowing you to observe that the correct data processing has taken place. They are not required, but are useful if you should need to investigate/debug the code.
